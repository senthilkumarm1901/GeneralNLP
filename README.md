This repository is dedicated to improving my NLP expertise.
It consists of original papers, my learning materials, my codes, among other useful links. 
With the NLP space changing ever so rapidly, this is my humble attempt to at least be aware of most of it and get to the bottom of the most important ones.

Good Resources to learn from (list will be updated continuously):
- Definition of all things NLP: https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress
